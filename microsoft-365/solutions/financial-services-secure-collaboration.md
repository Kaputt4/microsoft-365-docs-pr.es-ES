The protection of data, identities, devices, and applications is not only critical to their business, it's subject to compliance requirements and guidelines from regulatory bodies such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). In addition, financial institutions are subject to laws such as Dodd-Frank and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5a34a-p101">Financial services institutions surpass nearly all commercial businesses in their demand for stringent security, compliance, and governance controls.

<span data-ttu-id="5a34a-p104">Collaboration typically requires various forms of communication, the ability to store and access documents/data, and the ability to integrate other applications as needed. Employees in financial services typically need to collaborate and communicate with members of other departments or teams and sometimes with external entities. Therefore, using systems that create silos or make information sharing difficult is undesirable. Instead, it's preferable to leverage platforms and applications that enable employees to communicate, collaborate, and share information securely and according to corporate policy.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5a34a-p104">Collaboration typically requires various forms of communication, the ability to store and access documents/data, and the ability to integrate other applications as needed.

<span data-ttu-id="5a34a-p106">Teams provides a collaboration hub for the organization. It helps bring people together to work productively on common initiatives and projects. Teams lets team members conduct 1:1 and multi-party chat conversations, collaborate and coauthor documents, and store and share files. Teams also facilitates online meetings through integrated enterprise voice and video. Teams can also be customized with Microsoft apps such as Microsoft Planner, Microsoft Dynamics 365, PowerApps, PowerBI, and third-party line-of-business applications. Teams is designed for use by both internal team members and permitted external users who can join team channels, participate in chat conversations, access stored files, and leverage other applications</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5a34a-p106">Teams provides a collaboration hub for the organization.

<span data-ttu-id="5a34a-p107">Every Microsoft Team is backed by a Microsoft 365 group. That group is considered the membership service for numerous Office 365 services, including Teams. Microsoft 365 groups are used to securely distinguish between "owners" and "members" and to control access to various capabilities within Teams. When coupled with appropriate governance controls and regularly administered access reviews, Teams allows only members and owners to utilize authorized channels and capabilities.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5a34a-p107">Every Microsoft Team is backed by a Microsoft 365 group.

<span data-ttu-id="5a34a-p108">A common scenario where Teams benefits financial services is when running internal projects or programs. For example, many financial institutions, including banks, wealth management firms, credit unions, and insurance providers, are required to have anti-money laundering and other compliance programs in place. A cross-functional team comprised of IT, lines of business such as retail and wealth management, and a financial crime unit may be required to share data with each other and communicate about the program or specific investigations. Traditionally, these programs have used shared network drives, but this approach can present numerous challenges, including:</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5a34a-p108">A common scenario where Teams benefits financial services is when running internal projects or programs.

<span data-ttu-id="5a34a-p109">Teams can provide a collaboration space to securely store sensitive client data and conduct conversations between team members where sensitive topics may be discussed. Multiple members of the team can edit or collaborate on a single document at the same time. The program owner or coordinator can be configured as the team owner and can then add and remove members as needed.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5a34a-p109">Teams can provide a collaboration space to securely store sensitive client data and conduct conversations between team members where sensitive topics may be discussed.

<span data-ttu-id="5a34a-p110">Another common scenario is to use Teams as a "virtual data room" to securely collaborate, including storing and managing documents. Team members and syndicates within investment banking, asset management, or private equity firms can securely collaborate on a deal or investment. Cross-functional teams are often involved in planning and fulfilling such deals, and the ability to securely share data and conduct conversations is a core requirement. Securely sharing related documents with external investors is also a key requirement. Teams provides a secure and fully auditable location from which to centrally store, protect, and share investment data.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5a34a-p110">Another common scenario is to use Teams as a "virtual data room" to securely collaborate, including storing and managing documents.

However, many regulated organizations want to control and understand which collaboration channels are currently in use by their employees, which channels may contain sensitive data, and ownership of organizational channels. To facilitate these governance controls, Microsoft 365 lets organization disable self-service teams creation. By using business process automation tools such as Microsoft Power Apps and Power Automate, organizations can build and deploy simple forms and approval processes for employees to request creation of a new team. When approved, the team can be automatically provisioned and a link sent to the requestor. In this way, organizations can design and integrate their compliance controls and custom requirements into the team-creation process.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5a34a-p116">Teams enables self-service creation of teams by default.

One of the most common attack vectors that affects users today is email phishing attacks. These attacks can be targeted at specific users and can be very convincing, with some call to action that prompts the user to click a malicious link or open an attachment that contains malware. Once a computer is infected, the attacker can either steal the user's credentials and move laterally across the organization or exfiltrate emails and data to look for sensitive information. Defender for Office 365 supports safe attachments and safe links by evaluating documents and links at click-time for potentially malicious intent and blocks access. Email attachments are opened in a protected sandbox before they're delivered to a user's mailbox. It also evaluates links in Office documents for malicious URLs. Defender for Office 365 also protects links and files in SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, and Teams. If a malicious file is detected, Defender for Office 365  automatically locks that file to reduce potential damage.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5a34a-p143">[Microsoft Defender for Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/office-365-atp?view=o365-worldwide) provides an integrated Microsoft 365 service that protects organizations from malicious links and malware delivered through email and Office documents.

<span data-ttu-id="5a34a-p145">[Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/what-is-cloud-app-security) enables organizations to enforce policies at a granular level and to detect behavioral anomalies based on individual user profiles that are automatically defined by using machine learning. MCAS policies can build on Azure Conditional Access policies to protect sensitive company assets by evaluating additional signals related to user behavior and properties of the documents that are accessed. Over time, MCAS learns what's typical behavior for each employee with regard to the data they access and the applications they use. Based on learned behavior patterns, policies can then automatically enforce security controls if an employee acts outside of that behavioral profile. For example, if an employee typically accesses an accounting application from 9 AM to 5 PM Monday through Friday but suddenly starts to access that application heavily on a Sunday evening, MCAS can dynamically enforce policies to require the user to reauthenticate. This helps ensure that the user's credentials haven't been compromised. MCAS can also help identify "shadow IT" in the organization, which helps information security teams ensure that employees are using sanctioned tools when they work with sensitive data. Finally, MCAS can protect sensitive data anywhere in the Cloud, even outside the Microsoft 365 platform. It allows organizations to sanction (or unsanction) specific external Cloud apps, controlling access and monitoring usage.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5a34a-p145">[Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/what-is-cloud-app-security) enables organizations to enforce policies at a granular level and to detect behavioral anomalies based on individual user profiles that are automatically defined by using machine learning.
